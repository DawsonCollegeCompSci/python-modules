Welcome

This is a set of learning modules designed to create a foundational knowledge in Python.
It has modules for complete beginners; programmers experienced with other languages can focus on the _Deep-Dive_ or
_Recap_ modules.  

A word about the environment: the lessons are packaged in Jupyter Notebooks. You have a number of options for proceeding, depending on your experience:
1. Follow the lesson links provided. This will open a Google Colaboratory interactive session where you can run the code provided, edit it, and generally play around. This is the recommended approach for this course. NOTE: Google Chrome is the recommended browser
2. Project Jupyter offers the free Binder service, which also provides an interactive environment. Note that all notebooks have not been validated for look & feel against Binder (in particular, Colaboratory uses a dialect of Markdown) but the code cells should all work
3. Fork this repository and run the notebooks locally. We recommend that you download Anaconda for a complete Python development environment locally.
