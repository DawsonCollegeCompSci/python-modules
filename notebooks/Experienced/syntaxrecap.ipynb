    "## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "Readability counts.\n",
    "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "Now is better than never.\n",
    "Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n",

    "# Syntax recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic syntax rules thae we covered in the first section:\n",
    "\n",
    "## End of lines and blocks\n",
    "- separate statements with a new line. Although you can use semi-colons to have multiple statements on a single line, don't do it! It is not straightforward and readable, which is the goal of every Python programmer\n",
    "- blocks are indicated with a `:` to start, and indentation to indicate that the subsequent lines are part of the block. the Typical amount of each indentation is 4 spaces (not tabs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments \n",
    "Comments start with the `#` symbol and end at the end of the line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "- no declaration\n",
    "- dynamic typing: can change the type to which a variable is bound\n",
    "- coding style: lowercase with underscores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators\n",
    "- strong typing: no automatic conversions of types\n",
    "- arithmetic: `* / % // + - **` and unary `+ -`\n",
    "    - // is used for integer or _floor_ division\n",
    "    - ** is used for exponent\n",
    "- relational: `< <= > >= == !=`\n",
    "- logical: boolean `not and or`\n",
    "- assignment and compound assignment: `= += -= *= /= %= //= **=`\n",
    "- string concatentation: `+`\n",
    "- coding convention: space around operators\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard input and output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_input = input(\"Enter something: \")\n",
    "print(\"This is what you wrote \", user_input)\n",
    "print(\"Control the last character to allow something, besides the default end of a new line\", end=\",\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## data types so far\n",
    "- int\n",
    "- float\n",
    "- Decimal\n",
    "- str\n",
    "- bool\n",
    "\n",
    "- string literals can be with ' or \". The only difference are the characters that you need to escape. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'I don\\'t know' #the ' is escaped with the \\ character to indicate it belongs to the string\n",
    "\"He said \\\"Bye!\\\" when I left\" #the \" need to be escaped\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Other common escape character: \\n for newline\n",
    "\n",
    "- boolean literals are `True` and `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversion\n",
    "- an arithmetic operation with an `int` and a `float` will result in a `float`: this is because Python will implicitly convert the int to a float \n",
    "- use these functions when you need to to explitly convert\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "float_value = float(int_value)\n",
    "float_value = float(str_value)\n",
    "int_value = int(float_value)\n",
    "int_value = int(str_value)\n",
    "str_value = str(numeric_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional statements\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:  #parentheses not required\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "statement  # not part of the loop. You can add a line before if the block was long\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- no switch statement in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repetition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition: #paranthesis not required\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(start, end):\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "for i in range(start, end, increment):\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "- note that the `range` function actually generates a sequence over which we iterate, upto but not including `end`\n",
    "- the `break` statement can terminate the loop that it is within, and program flow goes to the next statement after the loop\n",
    "- the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the lines within the loop, and continue at the next iteration of the loop\n",
    "- you cannot break or continue out of multiple loops (no labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple assignment\n",
    "- Python allows multiple assignments to happen at the same time. Note that this is not the same thing as a _tuple_ which we will cover shortly. *Only* use this syntax if the two assignments should happen at the same time, in other words, the second assignment doesn't depend on the first assignment happeing. Also, *only* use for related variables (remember that you need your code to be readable to other programmers). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "start, end = 1, 10\n",
    "for i in range(start, end):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, write the code that will:\n",
    "- ask the user for a number\n",
    "- find the sum of all that number's divisors (or factors, basically numbers that divide into the user's number without leaving a remainder)\n",
    "- display the sum of the divisors\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your code with some test data. For example, if you enter 2, your result should be 3, since the sum of the factors of 2 is 1+2. If you enter 15, your sum will be 1 + 3+ 5 + 15 or 24"
