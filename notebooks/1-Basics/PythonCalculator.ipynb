Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be 7 + 8 = 15, but this is not the answer because clock time \"wraps around\" every 12 hours. Because the hour number starts over after it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12.\" In a formula, I would represent this clock arithmetic as `(7 + 8) % 12` Write this expression in any of the code cells, run it and see what your answer is.\n",
