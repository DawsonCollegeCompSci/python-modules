    "- `print` is case sensitive. Try changing `print` to `Print` and notice that it will not work. Python is a case-sensitive language, meaning that the exact characters that you use to write commands and code makes a difference\n",
    "- `print` will add a new line character to the end when it is done by default\n",
    "- `print` with no parameters will just be a new line, in this case the empty line that you see when you run the code above\n",
    "- you can send multiple strings to the `print` function, separating them with a comma. The function will print the first fring, then a space, then the next string. The space after the comma is a style convention: this means it is a typical thing that Python programmers do to make their code readable, in the same way we add a space after a comma when writing in English. In fact, Python coders are careful to make sure that their code is highly readable, since code is read much more often than it is written\n",
    "- the fourth `print` invocation has something new: instead of just a string literal, there is a named argument, referred to as a _keyword argument_.  This allows you to indicate how the `print` function should end the line; instead of a default new line, the line end with a space and the cursor stays on teh same line. This allows the next `print` function to write on the same line. We will see more on keyword arguments later.\n",

It then _returns_ the string of what you wrote. _Return_ means that the function gives back value to where it was invoked. The `=` sign indicates assignment: it means that the string that the `input` function returned is assigned to the variable `name`; this allows you to refer to the user input with the variable `name`.
